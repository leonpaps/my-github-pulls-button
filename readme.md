How to use it.

# How

### Step 1 (read)
Read the code in the plugins folder to decide if you trust me.
The manifest tells it to run the js file on github.

The js file just adds a button.

### Step 2 (write?)
Add the plugin to chrome by following [this](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en) guide

### Step 3 (execute!)
That's it!

### Licence:
This code is available under the _don't be a dick licence_

It is an original work. Read it, play with it and lear from it.

You are free to share it, modify it and even take credit for it, but that would a dick move.
